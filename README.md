# UK Academia IP Address Ranges

When conducting research, I have often used academia as a source of test data. To collect this information, I often use the information found associated to the JANET AS - ASN786. Using sites such as BGPview, the user can browse this information however, this data is not formatted well. So this repo looks to fix that! 

Contained within is an easy-to-read **Markdown** version for quick look-up and a **CSV** file for practical uses.

I am led to believe that this is not a comprehensive list of all IP ranges assigned. Therefore, if you know of any ommittances, please contribute. Also feel free to point out any mistakes too!
